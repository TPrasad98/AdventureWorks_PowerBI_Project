## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where you've been hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst by AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company producing cycling equipment and accessories. Your task is to build a comprehensive BI solution to help the management team track key performance indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

## Objectives

1. **Connect and Transform Raw Data**: Import and clean data from multiple sources, including transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.
2. **Build a Relational Data Model**: Create relationships between tables to form a cohesive data model that supports complex queries and analysis.
3. **Calculate Measures with DAX**: Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures for advanced data analysis.
4. **Design Interactive Dashboards**: Develop visually appealing and interactive reports and dashboards to present the data insights effectively.

## Project Steps

### 1. Connecting & Shaping Data

- **Tools Used**: Power Query Editor
- **Processes**: 
  - Connecting to various data sources.
  - Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure consistency and reliability.
  - Merging and appending queries to consolidate data.

### 2. Building a Data Model

- **Tools Used**: Power BI Desktop
- **Processes**: 
  - Creating relationships between tables.
  - Understanding and setting the correct cardinality and filter flow.
  - Optimizing the data model for performance and usability.

### 3. Calculating Measures with DAX

- **Tools Used**: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- **Processes**: 
  - Adding calculated columns and measures.
  - Writing common DAX formulas and functions for advanced analytics.
  - Optimizing DAX calculations for performance.

### 4. Visualizing Data with Dashboards

- **Tools Used**: Power BI Visualization Tools
- **Processes**: 
  - Inserting various charts and visuals.
  - Customizing formats for better readability and aesthetics.
  - Editing interactions and applying filters and bookmarks for an interactive user experience.

## Data Sources

The project uses various CSV files containing raw data about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. These data sets are essential for building a comprehensive BI solution.

## Installation

1. **Download Power BI Desktop**: [Power BI Desktop Download](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop)
2. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AdventureWorks-Project.git
   ```
3. **Open the Project**: Launch Power BI Desktop and open the `.pbix` file from the cloned repository.

## Usage

1. **Navigate the Data Model**: Explore the relationships and tables in the model view.
2. **Interact with Dashboards**: Use the report view to interact with various charts, slicers, and tables to gain insights from the data.
3. **Modify and Extend**: Feel free to modify the data model, add new measures, and create additional visualizations to extend the analysis.
